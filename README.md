# Real-Time Volumetric Cloud Renderer
![logo|20%](res/readme/logo.gif)

This project introduces an efficient and effective method to render animated, lifelike clouds in real-time. The dynamic nature of our clouds allows them to react to other world-parameters like the position of the camera or the sun. Our clouds are conveniently parameterized to allow for flexible customization for densities, positions, sizes, etc.
